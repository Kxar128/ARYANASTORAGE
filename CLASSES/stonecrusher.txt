Purchase

If you've spent at least $9.95 on ACs or membership, you can claim the Infinity Titan Bonus Package from your online account manager. It rewards the Infinity Titan class, which is a duplicate of StoneCrusher, meaning you won't need to do the farming below.

Otherwise, purchase the Earth’s Song Token and Shaman armor from Ravinos Brightglade at /gaiazor for 50k Gold each. Then, merge them in the same shop for the Stonecrusher class.
