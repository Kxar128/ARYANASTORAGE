Quest

Complete Barnabus' "Blood Moon Token" quest from /mogloween in October. If you're a member, complete the member version. Merge the class with 300 Blood Moon Tokens.
For the quest, simply defeat the Black Unicorn and Lycan Guard at /bloodmoon. Their drops stack to 100 each. Normally you'd have to complete the storyline here but you can also /goto someone who's at those enemies.

Vampire Lord is a duplicate of the Rare "Enchanted Vampire Lord", "Royal Vampire Lord", and "Vampire" classes. If you are an older player who owns any of them, you do not need this class.
