Story Completion
For most quests, you can /goto someone instead of doing the storyline. However, it's best to do them yourself as some storylines are also needed for other things. They include:
13 Lord of Chaos storyline, /rivensylth > /elfhame > /darkheart > /gaiazor, /celestialrealm > /lostruins > /lostruinswar, /seraph, /twilightslums > /palace, /volcano > /xantown > /xancave, /poisonforest, /citadel, 
If you're a non-member, you also have to complete the quests at /temple, /banished, Step 1 of the Blinding Light of Destiny farm up to and including "A Loyal Follower", /frozentower > /frozenruins > /northstar, and Warlic's and Cysero's quests at /battleontown > /downward.

If Member: Rank 10 Healer and Warrior
Get these from /trainers and rank them up according to the XP section of the New Player guide.

Complete the following quests at /darkthronehub:

1. A Strong Base

Stone Paladin Armour
After completing all levels of /temple, return to the Stone Paladin at the top and do their "Galvanize the Guardian" quest. For it, purchase a Scroll of Cure Petrification from their Merge shop with drops from Shelletons, which are in the 1st level of the Temple. After, purchase the Stone Paladin Armour from their Temple shop.

Exalted Paladin Seal
Purchase from Artix's Rep shop at /darkthronehub for 500k Gold.



2. Proof of Valor

Undead Energy x1000
Defeat enemies at /battleunderb. Make sure you've completed Step 1 of BLoD (see Requirements section) otherwise this won't drop.

Binky's Uni-horn
Defeat Binky at /doomvault. You can get there quickly by talking to Valencia at /museum and selecting Artifact Quests > Armour of Awe > To the Crossroads. Then talk to Valencia again and select Armour of Awe > AQW Hero > More Details > Cape Boss.
Because of Binky's difficulty, you'll most likely need a group of people to help fight it too. Binky has numerous abilities, including stuns ranging from 5-21 seconds, Skill Lock, which stops one of your abilities from being used (try and bait this with the Mana Vamp awe enhancement, a scroll, or your least useful ability first), and Prophetic Vision, which reflects your damage to you (avoid this by pressing ESC). Use the chance to get Cape of Awe, and if you have the Hardcore Paragon Pet, accept its "A Single Rib" quest.

Desterrat Moya Tentacle
Defeat Desterrat Moya at /banished.

Dreadhaven Helm
Defeat Dreadhaven General at /dreadhaven.

DoomKitten Claw
Defeat DoomKitten at /doomkitten. I recommend using classes that deal damage through DoTs, like Blaze Binder, DeathKnight, ShadowStalker of Time, Timeless Dark Caster, or Infinity Knight, as critical damage heals DoomKitten.

Vordred's Skull
Defeat Vordred at /vordredboss by clicking Continue in the middle.



3. Mastering the Arcane

Pyromancer Artifact
Defeat Xan at /xantown (3% drop rate).
