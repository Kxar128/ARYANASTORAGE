Requirements

Level 80

15+ Spare Inventory Slots

Hadean Onyx of Nulgath
Use the Reagent Library and search for this item - if you haven't been through /tercessuinotlim before, use the guide. This needs to be in your inventory to accept the main farming quest.

Voucher of Nulgath (non-mem)
Use the Reagent Library. It's near the bottom. This needs to be in your inventory to accept the main farming quest.

Recommended: A Good Farming Class
This might include Blaze Binder, Chaos Slayer, Vampire Lord, ArchFiend, or even better, Dragon of Time or Legion Revenant. This will cut down the time it takes to get Void Highlord.

Step 1

You should obtain 15 Roentgeniums of Nulgath before doing the Void Crystals because you can earn reagents for the Void Crystals as you get Roentgeniums - it's more efficient.

To start, enter /tercessuinotlim and go to the Void Highlord NPC. If you've never been to /tercessuinotlim before, use the guide. After, accept the "Void Highlord's Challenge" quest from the NPC. If you can't accept it, look at the Requirements tab above.

Use the Reagent Library for details on how to get the following items (the total required amounts are parenthesised):

Aelita's Emerald (15)

ArchFiend's Favour x300 (4500)

Black Knight Orb (15)

Elders' Blood (17)

You will get 1 Roentgenium each time you complete the quest. You need 15 to merge the class.

Step 2

These can be merged at the Void Highlord NPC's shop, along with the class itself when you're done. You only need 1 of each Void Crystal.
