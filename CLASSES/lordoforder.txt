Weapon Imprint x15
Defeat Undead Raxgore at /doomvaultb. You must have completed the quests at both /doomvault and /doomvaultb to access him as /goto does not work.

Then talk to Valencia again and select Armour of Awe > AQW Legend/Hero > More Details > Helm Boss.
While fighting him, be careful as he can lock your abilities and has an ability called Counter Attack - you'll need to target off by clicking the X to the top-right of their portrait or pressing ESC. Use the chance to get the Helm of Awe if you haven't already.
