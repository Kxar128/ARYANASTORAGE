Stacking Boosts

Boosts of the same kind don't stack.
For example, if you equipped the Cape of Awe (25% XP, CP, Gold, Rep) and then the Dark Summoner armour (15% Rep), you would have 25% XP, CP, Gold and Rep overall boost, as the game follows the highest boost equipped.
However, consumable boosts, server boosts, and gear boosts will all stack with each other, even if they're the same kind. For example, you could mix a 48hr XP server boost, a 1hr XP consumable boost, and the Cape of Awe. This would be the best time to farm if you can align all three.

What about damage boosts?
Similar to above, you wouldn't be able to stack two damage boosts that do the same thing. However, you can stack items that boost damage to All with something else that boosts damage to a tagged enemy. For example, if you equipped the Void Warlock Armour (25% All) with the Blinding Light of Destiny (75% Undead), you would deal 118.75% extra damage against Undead enemies and 25% damage against every other enemy.

How do boosts stack?
You may be wondering why the previous example of stacking the Void Warlock Armour and Blinding Light of Destiny (BLoD) resulted in a 118.75% boost. Why not 100%? This is because stacked boosts are calculated multiplicatively, not additively.
For the Void Warlock Armour and BLoD, it would be calculated like this: 1.25 x 1.75 = 2.1875

Anything else?
Damage boosts do not affect DoTs (Damage over Time) or HoTs (Heal over Time).
