Seasonal

★ = Most Important  |  ☆ Important



January - February

★ Nulgath's Birthday Gift - 1500 ACs
Purchased from the Game Menu during Nulgath's Birthday event. Used to speed up farming for items required for Nation farms. Well worth it.



February - March

Evolved Leprechaun - 2000 ACs or Farmed
Obtainable from /luck. If farming, you'll need to complete Mog O'Rahilly's quests for 12 Lucky Clovers by defeating Lucky Harms at /rainbow (daily) and 20 Rainbow Shards by defeating Rainbow Rats at /rainbow. You'll also need 2000 Golden Tickets, which can be obtained by your minigame of choice at /luck or by completing William Sneevil's "A-MAZE-ing Race" quest by finding Pot O' Golds at /hedge and defeating Monochrome at /rainbow. This class has great GDPS (group dmg) potential 



March - April

★ Shogun Paragon Pet - Farmed (2000 LTs)
Available at the Future War Merge shop at /futurewar. Used to farm Legion Tokens. Highly recommended.

★ Legion DoomKnight - Farmed (2000 LTs) or 2000 ACs
Purchased from the Game Menu during Dage's Birthday event. This is a well-rounded class that's worth getting but only after obtaining the Shogun Paragon pet. Would not recommend purchasing for ACs since Legion Tokens are easy to farm with the Shogun pet.

Timeless Dark Caster - 2000 ACs
Purchased from the Game Menu during Dage's Birthday event. Unfortunately, most of its damage comes from DoTs so it doesn't scale well when you use damage boosts as they have no effect on them.

Immortal Dark Caster - 2000 ACs
Purchased from the Game Menu during Dage's Birthday event. Like Timeless Dark Caster, it's a fine choice for soloing but it's not needed if you're planning to get Legion DoomKnight.

Legion SwordMaster Assassin - Farmed (5000 LTs)
Available in the Dark Birthday Token merge shop at /darkbirthday. Requires 5000 LTs and 300 Obsidian Rocks, which are from Dage's "Obsidian Mining", or if you're a member "Undead Legion Member Special", quest. Defeat the Skeletal Fire Mages in the 4th level down at /temple. Not the most important thing to buy. Only get it if you have leftover Legion Tokens.



April

Vorpal Bunny - Farmed
Complete the "Egg Hunt - Vorpal Bunny" quest from Cabdury at /battleon during the Easter event. You'll need all eggs, which are hidden around /battleon and /battleontown, and a drop from Grenwog at /grenwog. Used to farm Gold by selling the armour rewarded from its "Bunny Berzerker Armour - Were Egg", however, this method is not the most efficient. See the Gold guide for more information.



May

★ Dark Lord - Farmed
Complete the storyline quests at /murdermoon. After, you can merge the class.



September

Heroic/Legendary Naval Commander - 100k Gold (mem-only) or 2000 ACs
Purchase from the Game Menu during Talk Like A Pirate Day event. Decent farming class but not worth purchasing for ACs.

Pirate - Farmed
Complete Elissa Keelhaul's quests including "Map Recovery" from /pirates for Classic Pirate. Fight one enemy with it then complete Kervaal's "New Pirate Class" from /blazebeard by defeating an Undead Pirate in the same map.

☆ Iara Merge Weapons - Insignias
Purchase from the Iara Merge at /ultraiara. They will require 5 Iara Insignias each, which involves completing "Ultra Iara" by defeating Ultra Iara. This is a daily quest. For more information on how to defeat Ultra Iara and other Ultra Bosses, see the guide for it.

★ Polly Roger - Farmed
This pet requires Level 80. Get it from Barnaby's "Sailor of the Celestial Skies" quest at /pirates. Many of the enemies you need to defeat are very hard, so I highly suggest asking people to help you out from /yulgar or /battleon.
Other reward pieces have the same effect but having it in a pet is more convenient. It will boost your damage by 30% to all tagged enemies but not every enemy, as many don't have a monster type. Because of this, it can be used with a weapon that boosts your damage to All enemies.



October

★ Vampire Lord - 2000 ACs or Farmed
Purchase for 2k ACs or farm one of Barnabus' Blood Moon Token quests (if you're a member, complete the member version) located at /mogloween during the Mogloween event in October. You'll need 300 Blood Moon Tokens to merge the Vampire Lord class.
Vampire Lord is a great farming class if you don't already own something like ArchFiend or Legion Revenant.

Evolved Pumpkin Lord - 2000 ACs or Farmed
If farming for this, it can be dropped by Great Pumpkin King at /mogloween during October or merged for 500 Glowing Pumpkinseeds, which are dropped by Apephryx at /cruxship, during any time of the year. Otherwise, purchased for ACs from the Game Menu during the Mogloween event - I wouldn't recommend buying it for ACs.



November

Abyssal Angel's Shadow - 2000 ACs
Purchase from the Game Menu during the Black Friday event. It's a defensive high-tier farming class. Not necessarily needed if you already own Vampire Lord but it's still good in its own right, especially for low HP targets.

Dark Ultra OmniNight - 2000 ACs
Purchase from the Game Menu during the Black Friday event. It's a good option for a soloing class but isn't needed if you already have other strong soloing classes.

Dark BattleMage - 2000 ACs
Available during the Game Menu during the Black Friday event. Not worth getting when you can get the normal version with Rank 10 Swordhaven for no AC cost.



December - January

☆ Frostval Barbarian - 2000 ACs or Farmed
Obtained from /frostvale via Robina's "Unleash the Frostvale Barbarian" quest or with ACs during the Frostvale event. It's useful for healing and supporting classes with crit and mana buffs. However, it's generally outclassed as a solo support by classes such as Lord of Order and StoneCrusher. In a group it shines, for example, it's used in the optimal setup for the Exaltia Ultra Bosses. If this interests you, click here for more info.

Northlands Monk - Farmed
Obtained by defeating FrozenSoul Queen at /frozensoul during Frostvale event. Very mediocre class - outclassed by other support classes.
