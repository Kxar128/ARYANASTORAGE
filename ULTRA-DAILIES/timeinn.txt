ULTRAEZRAJAL:

DPS, LoO, LR, AP/VDK

don't forget to prelock abilities that are useless in ur kits by attacking ezrajal and leaving room before dying, when ur ability is unclickable or it says on screen in yellow text " (the ability) has been locked" then it's finished

you can lock ur weapon enchancement also by auto attacking ONLY


Boss Mechanics:

At some point the boss will start countering all abilities, pay attention to the text prompt for this, stop attacking during this phase and when the counter attack aura fades then you can start attacking again.

during this counter attack phase focus on healing and not dying.
