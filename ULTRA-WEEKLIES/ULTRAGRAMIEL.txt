ULTRAGRAMIEL

:crossed_swords: ULTRA GRAMIEL :crossed_swords:
Phase 1:
2 classes alternates taunt on each cristal in the text: "The Grace Crystal prepares a defense shattering attack!"

It can be something like:
 LR takes the first taunt on the left crystal 
 Shaman takes the first taunt on right crystal  
 SC takes the second taunt on left crystal 
 LoO takes the second taunt on right crystal 

Everyone turns to attack Gramiel (mid Boss) when it says "Gramiel attempts to drain your power… break his guard!"

*Note: Shaman should stack his skill 5 on Gramiel (mid Boss).
*Note 2: LR shouldn't use his skill 2 on phase 1 (decay)

Phase 2:
 DPS should call taunts by class
