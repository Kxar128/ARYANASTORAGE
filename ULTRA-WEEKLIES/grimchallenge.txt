**Chrono ShadowSlayer**:
Lock 3 or 5 or prelock
Enh and potions: luck class, base forge helm, penitence/vainglory, Arcana Concerto for good ping Valiance for bad/mid ping, unstable fate tonic, unstable battle elixer, feli pot
tip 1: During Meow, BLEEECH, Listen, Truth, Drakath mechanic, Dage mechanic and Kathool mechanic he won't reset your rift stacks so spam 4 and try to 5 before the text fades.
tip 2: At start of fight Binky will nuke the team which deals 1,350-9,500 damage spread across each active fighter. Don't attack with the team wait until after this nuke happens.
tip 3: Try to control dps at 35-30 million HP mark in case LR takes the BLEEEEECH. LR will most likely die from the warden hp drop because the BLEEEECH decay is still on them
tip 4: If you're running feli pot try to gunslinger just as the haste debuff from Kathool mechanic hits so you can still deal damage while debuffed

**Archfiend**:
Prelock a weapon enh
Enh and potions: luck class, base forge helm, penitence, ravenous, fate tonic, potent battle, vigil
tip: use 4 and 5 at 15 million hp and spam it off cooldown and pray CSS can nuke binky to below 5 million HP during the "You will not Resist" text

**Legendary Hero**:
Lock 2 
Enh and potions: luck class, base forge helm, absolution, valiance, fate tonic, divine elixir, vigil
tip 1: Use your 5 when Binky is at 30,500,000 health so the team doesn't die to the warden mechanic
tip 2: wait until loo quix aura (LOO SKILL 5) is halfway done until you press 5 at the Kathool mechanic
tip 3: DO NOT use skill 5 at 45 million health your HOT will kill the taunter
tip 4: Latest you can use your skill 5 is 15 million health 

**Lord of Order**:
Lock weapon enh
Enh and potions: luck class, base forge helm, penitence, mana vamp, fate tonic, divine elixir, vigil
tip 1: stop using quix (LOO SKILL 5) at 20 million hp
tip 2: use quix (LOO SKILL 5) after health drops at kathool mechanic
tip 3: try to use quix at 45 million hp (HEAL INVERT) so that the person taking heal invert doesn't die
tip 4: try to use quix at 30 million hp (WARDEN MECHANIC) in case your healers heal cooldowns are not up 

**Archpaladin**:
Lock weapon enh
Enh and potions: luck class, base forge helm, lament, mana vamp, unstable fate tonic, unstable battle, vigil
tip 1: try to seal (AP SKILL 4) at 45 mil HP (HEAL INVERT) so whoever taunts that doesn't die
tip 2: try to seal 35 million HP so whoever takes BLEEECH doesn't die
tip 3: Heal and seal as often as possible. After heal invert mechanic fades around 43 million hp
tip 4: after health drop from kathool mechanic (around 8-7 million HP) heal and try to time seal for when quix (LOO SKILL 5) aura is 75% done
tip 5: use AP seal at 15 mil HP because your seal is basically a decay

**Verus DoomKnight**:
Lock skill 4
Enh and potions: luck class, base forge helm, vainglory, ravenous/dauntless, fate tonic, potent battle, scroll of enrage
tip 1: If you're using dauntless people can heal if you taunt the heal invert at 45 million HP. Let the team know if you take the heal invert and you're on dauntless
tip 2: If you're on dauntless save your life steal skill (VDK SKILL 3) for the Binky 30 million HP mechanic
tip 3: If you're on dauntless stop spamming 2 at YOU WILL NOT RESIST so that you can get healed by the party. 

**Legion Revenant**:
Lock 5 preferred but if it locks arcana concerto cry a little inside
Enh and potions: wiz class, healer helm/hearty helm, penitence, arcana concerto, sage tonic, potent malevolence, scroll of enrage
tip 1: stop spamming your 4 at 47 million HP in case you take the heal invert taunt at 45 million HP.  After the heal invert fades spam all skills again
tip 2: spam your 2 at 15 million HP


""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
TIP FOR TAUNTERS: Lock a skill before using taunt 

TIP FOR USING VIGIL: Use vigil 2-3 seconds after the "YOU WILL NOT RESIST" text appears. Most of the time with the fast comp Binky will be well below 10 million HP when he does the "YOU WILL NOT RESIST" text

TIP FOR HEALERS: Stop spamming heals at 45 million HP. Resume healing after 5 seconds. Spam heal after he nukes your health

TIP FOR LOCKING: You can go to /ultraezrajal or /binky if you are a mem to lock mana vamp and swap to a weapon enh you need like ravenous before starting the fight to keep all your skills and enhancements
