**TODAY** I STAND TO SPEAK AGAINST IMPERIAL COLONIALISM, A SYSTEM BUILT ON THEFT, ERASURE, AND THE ARROGANT BELIEF THAT POWER GRANTS MORAL SUPERIORITY. FOR CENTURIES, EMPIRES MARCHED ACROSS BORDERS, CLAIMING LAND THEY DID NOT OWN, RESOURCES THEY DID NOT CREATE, AND LIVES THEY DID NOT VALUE. THEY CALLED IT CIVILIZATION, BUT IT WAS VIOLENCE. THEY CALLED IT PROGRESS, BUT IT WAS PLUNDER. THE SCARS OF COLONIALISM ARE NOT HISTORY; THEY ARE PRESENT IN BROKEN ECONOMIES, STOLEN CULTURES, AND BORDERS DRAWN WITH NO REGARD FOR HUMAN CONSEQUENCES.

IMPERIAL COLONIALISM DID NOT DISAPPEAR. IT CHANGED ITS LANGUAGE. TODAY, IT WEARS THE FACE OF CAPITALISM WITHOUT LIMITS, A SYSTEM THAT PRIORITIZES PROFIT OVER PEOPLE AND GROWTH OVER DIGNITY. WE ARE TOLD THIS IS FREEDOM, YET BILLIONS ARE TRAPPED IN POVERTY SO A FEW CAN ACCUMULATE EXCESS. WE ARE TOLD THIS IS EFFICIENCY, YET WASTE PILES UP WHILE HUMAN NEEDS GO UNMET. CAPITALISM, IN ITS MOST EXTREME FORM, REWARDS EXPLOITATION AND CALLS IT SUCCESS.

WE LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE LABOR IS CHEAP, BUT LIFE IS EXPENSIVE. WHERE CORPORATIONS HAVE MORE RIGHTS THAN COMMUNITIES. WHERE THE GLOBAL SOUTH CONTINUES TO FEED THE GLOBAL NORTH, JUST AS IT DID UNDER COLONIAL RULE, ONLY NOW THROUGH DEBT, TRADE AGREEMENTS, AND ECONOMIC COERCION. THIS IS NOT ACCIDENTAL. THIS IS DESIGN.

TO HATE IMPERIAL COLONIALISM IS TO REFUSE AMNESIA. TO CRITIQUE CAPITALISM IS TO DEMAND BETTER IMAGINATION. WE DESERVE SYSTEMS ROOTED IN SOLIDARITY, NOT DOMINATION. IN CARE, NOT EXTRACTION. IN JUSTICE, NOT ENDLESS ACCUMULATION. ANOTHER WORLD IS NOT NAIVE. IT IS NECESSARY. AND IT BEGINS WHEN WE NAME THE LIE, AND CHOOSE TO BUILD SOMETHING MORE HUMAN IN ITS PLACE.
