Member

If you're in a group, complete GrimDawn/Dusk's "Executive Doom OverLord Challenge" quest from /necrodungeon by defeating the Doom Overlord in the same map.

Otherwise, complete Yulgar's "Free Us, Oh Brave One!" quest from /yulgarzombie by defeating the Dark Dracozombie in the same map. 
Requires completing Yulgar's previous quests and keeping the reward (the enemies for the previous quests are located at /templeb > /battleunderb > /doomwar).



Non-Mem

If you're in a group, complete GrimDawn/Dusk's "Doom OverLord Challenge" quest from /necrodungeon by defeating the Doom Overlord in the same map.

Otherwise, complete "Minion Morale", "Shadowfall is DOOMed", and "Grave-lyn Danger" quests from /shadowfall (click the Quests button at the top-right). You have to accept each of them separately from each screen in the map but then you can complete them all in the same room - I suggest the one with 2 Undead War Mages and 2 Ghouls.
Also make sure to enable Quest Log Turn-Ins and Reaccept Quest After Turn-In from Advanced Options. This way you can keep your Quest Log open and turn in quests from there. You can access your Quest Log by pressing L.

Dailies

Complete the "Mine Crafting" quest from Artix, and "Hard Core Metals" from Vayle if you're a member, from /necropolis by defeating Balboa at /stalagbite. These quests reward metals which are used for BLoD, SDKA, and NSoD.
