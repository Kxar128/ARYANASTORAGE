Member + Non Mem

Accept Cysero's "Volatile Temper Agent for Blacksmithing" and "Glowing Temper Agent for Blacksmithing" quests from /yulgar in the upstairs bathroom. If you're a member, also accept "Unknown Alloy for Blacksmithing".
Complete them by using Chaoroot and Dragon Scales with Dragon Runestones at the /alchemy minigame. See the Alchemy guide if you aren't familiar with it or the reagents.

If you don't want to do it that way, you'll need to complete Warlic's and Cysero's quests from /battleontown > /downward. Then, complete Cysero's "Magic Sock it To You" quest from /battleontown by defeating Slimes at /swordhavenbridge and Wolves at /greenguardeast.
