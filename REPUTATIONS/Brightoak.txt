I recommend doing the Spirit of Aven Greywhorl's "Defeat the Guardian Spirit" quest from /elfhame. This will be very fast in a group or if you're high level.

Otherwise, complete Ælfred's "Night in Shining Armour" quest from /rivensylth.

Select Evil and Chaos from Novus Bitterglow at the start of the map.

Equip the Temp Owl from your Temporary Inventory (click scroll button from bottom-right) then take top-left path and accept the "Night in Shining Armour" quest.

Then go back and equip Temp Fox. Take the path to the right into the caves.

Farm the screen with 3 enemies and turn in the quest when you've got 10/10.
