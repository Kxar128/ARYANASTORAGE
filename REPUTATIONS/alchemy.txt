Overview

Alchemy is a minigame where you can create consumables called Potions, Tonics, and Elixirs (all 3 might be abbreviated as Pots or Drugs). They can be equipped into and are used from your 6th slot.

Potions/Philtres
These have short effect durations (usually 15-45s) so use them in combat rather than before. They boost secondary stats, like Haste, Evasion, Crit Chance, and more. They might also restore HP or MP.

Tonics
These have longer effect durations (up to 15m) so you can use them before you start combat or during. They boost primary stats, like Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Endurance, Wisdom, and Luck.

Elixirs
These are a mix between the previous two. They boost secondary stats (at a smaller amount) like Potions but last a long time like Tonics.

You can also get Basic, Potent, or Unstable versions of a consumable. Basic is a weaker version and Potent is a stronger version. Unstable is also stronger but comes with a drawback, making it sometimes not worth using. If you're using a Dragon Runestone to brew (more info below) Potions and Elixirs will always be Potent or Unstable while Tonics will always be Regular or Unstable.

Best Consumables

If you don't know what to use, Lucky classes will generally use Battle/Fate and Wizard classes will generally use Malevolence/Fate (see whether your class uses Lucky or Wizard here). Felicitous Philtre and Potent Honour Potion preference depends on each class and you.

All mixed consumables below require Rank 8 Alchemy (Gebo Rune).

Reagents

Arashtite Ore
Trade a Dragon Runestone for 2.
Or, defeat Deathmoles at /orecavern.

Chaoroot

Purchase a Receipt of Swindle from Swindle's Ripoff Emporium at /tercessuinotlim and trade it for 10 Chaoroot. 

If you don't want to spend Gold, defeat Hydra Heads at /hydra - if you've already completed the story here, talk to the fairy at /mobius and select The Hydra.

You may also earn this from Escherion while farming "Supplies to spin The Wheel of Chance".

Chaos Entity
May drop from Fehu Rune while using Fish Oil + Dried Slime, Chaoroot + Dragon Scale, or Rhison Blood + Searbush.
Might also drop from Gebo Rune while using Fish Oil + Arashtite Ore/Ice Vapour or Chaoroot + Necrot.

Doomatter

Purchase a Receipt of Swindle from Swindle's Ripoff Emporium at /tercessuinotlim and trade it for 10 Doomatter.

 If you don't want to spend Gold, defeat Fear Feeder at the end of the map at /creepy. This requires membership.

If you're a non-member, join /vordredboss and click continue in the middle. As the cutscene is playing, you can't see it but you can actually still attack Vordred - just use a class that has powerful long-range abilities. This will skip a lot of the cutscene as you spam-click Next at the top-right. The final instance of the cutscene cannot be skipped by attacking.

If you don't want to spam that much, defeat Creature Creation at /maul.

Dragon Scale
Trade a Dragon Runestone for 2.
Or, defeat Draconians at /lair. 

Dried Slime
Trade a Dragon Runestone for 2.
Or, defeat Crashrooms at /orecavern.

Trade a Dragon Runestone for 3.
Or, may be rewarded when using a Dragon Runestone with any reagents.

Trade a Dragon Runestone for 2.
Or, defeat Snow Golems at /mountfrost or Water Draconians at /lair (will also reward Dragon Scales).

Or, defeat Lemurphants and Jungle Tigriffs at /ravinetemple. 

Moglin Tears
Trade a Dragon Runestone for 2.
 Or, defeat Sweetish Fish at /twig (take middle path to find them).

Necrot

Purchase a Receipt of Swindle from Swindle's Ripoff Emporium at /tercessuinotlim and trade it for 10 Necrot.

If you don't want to spend Gold, defeat the Undead Temple Mage at /templeb (I find that it drops more from the Mage than Fighters). This requires membership.

If you don't have membership, defeat Skeleton Fighters at /deathsrealm (there is no room with 2).

Nimblestem
Trade a Dragon Runestone for 2.
Or, defeat Swamp Frogdrakes and Lurkers at /mudluk (walk left>up from Paddylump to find 2 Frogdrakes - they have lower HP than Lurkers).

Or, defeat Rhison at /bloodtusk (there is no screen with 2).

Minigame

Reagents
Once you know what Potion, Tonic, or Elixir you want to create, check what Reagents it requires and obtain them - any that are used for farms will have their instructions on this site in their respective guide. The best consumables can be found in the above section with their information. You might need more reagents than you think because none are a guaranteed drop from the /alchemy minigame.



Runes
I highly recommend trading Gold Vouchers for Dragon Runestones in Alina's Get Dragon Runes shop at /alchemyacademy. They will make it so you don't have to do anything in the minigame.

After, join /alchemy. If you're using the Dragon Runestone, select the first Rune (it says +Bonus rep). Otherwise, check what the base level of the potion is and use the guide below to get your desired consumable:
Jera - Level 5-15 - Unlocks at Rank 1
Uruz - Level 16-25 - Unlocks at Rank 3
Fehu - Level 26-40 -  Unlocks at Rank 5
Gebo - Level 41+ - Unlocks at Rank 8



Mechanics
If you're using the Dragon Runestone, you don't need to worry about any mechanics. If you aren't, your main goal is to fill an empty potion bottle by balancing the heat.
To be efficient, the output should be maintained at 3 green circles, or 2 at the least - keep the mixture temperature at about 70-80 degrees. Use the red button to increase the heat or the blue button to freeze the runestone and stop it from overheating. Icicles from the blue button don't regenerate - fireballs from the red button do regenerate.
The harder the rune, the easier it is for it to overheat. Sometimes, a fireball will not hit the runestone and instead set the room on fire, putting the meter at 100 - you cannot avoid this. Similarly, the ice may not cool down the runestone and could actually put your meter at -30. If this happens, you may as well restart because you won't lose any reagents for leaving. You won't lose any for failing either but it's faster to just leave.



Ranking Up
If you want to rank up quickly, obtain 30 Chaoroot and Necrot from Swindle's Ripoff Emporium at /tercessuinotlim. Use them with Dragon Runestones or the highest rune you have access to.
