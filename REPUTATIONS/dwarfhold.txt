Complete Malorie's "Dwarfhold Membership Dues" quest from /collection.

Accept Drakath (Kid)'s "For Science" quest from /terrarium.

Join /collectorlab and defeat enemies there. Token Cs have a 70% drop rate and stack to 500.

Merge them for Token Bs > Token As in the Super Fan Token shop at /collection.

Getting from Rank 1-10 requires 25 Token As with a consumable Rep Boost and Cape of Awe (or other 25% boost).

Also make sure to enable Quest Log Turn-Ins and Reaccept Quest After Turn-In from Advanced Options. This way you can keep your Quest Log open and turn in quests from there. You can access your Quest Log by pressing L.

Complete Mick Guyver's "Jailhouse Rock" quest from /dwarfprison (they are located at the end of the map to the right). For it, defeat Warden Elfis, who's at the very left of the map past the metal bars. You must have completed the story to access this.
Also make sure to enable Quest Log Turn-Ins and Reaccept Quest After Turn-In from Advanced Options. This way you can keep your Quest Log open and turn in quests from there. You can access your Quest Log by pressing L.

If you're very low level, you may find it faster to do Mick's "Lodestone Locater" quest by farming Balboa at /stalagbite. Since these enemies are aggressive after respawning, swap between them and the room with Vath and Stalagbite to turn in the quest.
