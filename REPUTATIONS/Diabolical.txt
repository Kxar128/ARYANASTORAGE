Complete Hikari's Riddle Task quests from /banished by defeating the following enemies:

Unending Avatar at /timevoid (select Timevoid from Braeus' Fast Travel at /shadowfall).

ChaosWeaver Warrior at /twilightedge (keep walking right).

This is the quest that you would repeatedly complete for this method. It's quicker than "Insomniacs" but requires almost 3x the amount of turn-ins.
Tiger Leech at /mudluk. If you can't /goto someone, from the starting screen, walk left>right>up>left>up>up and click To Tiger Leech at the top-right.
If you haven't done the storyline before, complete it from /arcangrove > /cloister > /mudluk. Then you can unlock the gate by walking from the starting screen: left>right (click red crystal in this room)>up (click red crystal)>left>top-left>left (click red crystal)>right>up.

Death Alive at /deathsrealm. If you can't /goto someone, complete the quests at /death > /deathsrealm. The locations for completing these quests are: 
/death: /castleundead > /river, /lair, /citadel, /boxes, /orecavern, /creatures.
/deathsrealm: /bludrutbrawl or /doomarena > /deathsrealm x2 > /trainers > /elemental > /deathsrealm.

Purchase a Gold Voucher 100k from Alina's Get Dragon Runes shop at /alchemyacademy. Then trade it for the Vial of Antitoxins in her Buy Potions shop.

Manifestation of Grief at /ghostnexus (located near the end of the map). Either /goto someone or complete the quests from /aozorahills > /ghostnexus to access.

This is the quest that you would repeatedly complete for this method. It's slower than "The Third Task" but requires fewer turn-ins and is more easily completable by lower level players.
Dream Larva at /somnia (walk up twice from the starting screen - there is no room with 2).
