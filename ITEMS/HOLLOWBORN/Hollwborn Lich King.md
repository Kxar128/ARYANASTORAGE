Total amount of resources you need to finish Lae's Hollowborn Lich King quest

I only listed the requirements for each quest, pre-requisites to get some of these resources aren't included.



**30 Soul Sand (12 of these are required to make the listed 4 Soul Essence)**

**168 Soul Fragment**

**18 Lich King Fragment**

**44,800 Legion Token**

**4 Exalted Crown**

**4 Revenant Spellscroll**

**4 Conquest Wreath**

**4,200 Hollow Soul**

**4 Soul Essence**

**8,400 Undead Energy**





Just added the prerequisite Legion items to some listed resources.



**Ultimate Lich King - 10,000 Legion Token**



**Ultimate Lich King Helm - 5,000 Legion Token**



**Legion Bonfire - 10,000 Legion Token**



**Undead Champion - Legion membership required**



**For 30 Soul Sand, you need:**



**2,400 Dark Token**



**9,990 Bone Dust**



**12,000 Dage's Favor**



You can skip farming requirements for Soul Sand if you do Daily Exerise 5 and 6 from Dage in /underworld. You can get 3 Soul Sand daily.



I will assume that everyone who's working on this has access to Dage Insignias. You will need 10 insignias for spellscroll/wreath/crowns.



This list could be inaccurate so, if I lack anything in this list, feel free to add. Good luck!

Heard you're into some hardcore tasks. I've got something here and there for you, but FIRST, let's make a deal. There is some stuff I will need you to bring in order to summon this big guy here, and I need to make sure you agree with all the terms and so on. First I'll need Human Souls from any human in /noxustower, Fallen Souls from the Undead Paladin in /doomwood, and just one Soul Potion from /alchemy. Oh, don't forget you need to do it in my name. It will make sure the Souls will come right to me.
