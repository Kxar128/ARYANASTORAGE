Requirement

Storyline Completion
This is from /originul > /fiendshard.

Armour/Weapons

Complete "It Calls to You" from /fiendshard. All rewards from this quest provide a 40% (except for the armour, which provides 30%) damage boost against tagged enemies, like Undead or Chaos. Despite the lower boost of the armour, it's actually the best option because it can be stacked with a weapon that boosts damage to All enemies.

Complete "The Swirling Abyss Gathers" from /fiendshard. All rewards from this quest provide a 20% damage boost against tagged enemies. You don't need to do this quest as it's best to just get the armour from "It Calls to You" as the boost is 30%. See below if you still want to do it anyway.
