Quest

Complete Zee's "Void Spartan" quest from /tercessuinotlim.

Use the Reagent Library for details on how to get the following items:

Unidentified 13

Zee's Red Jasper

Gem of Nulgath x10

Fiend Cloak of Nulgath

Blood Gem of the ArchFiend x5

You'll need to turn in this quest 11 times if you want every item so I suggest stacking any reagents you can.
