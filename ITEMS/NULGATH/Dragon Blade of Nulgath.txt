Recommended: Sword of Nulgath pet
Don't have one? Do one of these:

Complete "Nulgath (Larvae)" for the 8th Betrayal Blade of Nulgath - either equip it or activate its quests from your inventory.

Use a Bonus Package from your online account management and claim the Copper Void ChronoKnight set for the Copper Void Blade pet, which can be equipped by non-members too. 

As a member, you can get the original Sword of Nulgath pet by trading a Voucher of Nulgath, Voucher of Nulgath (non-mem) (use Reagent Library for these two Vouchers), Dark Crystal pet from /ariapet, and Dark Makai Rune from Makai at /nulgath, to Nulgath's "Purchase Sword of Nulgath" quest at /tercessuinotlim, or if you own it, your ENNH.

Quest

Complete "Demanding Items Of Nulgath" from either your Sword of Nulgath pet or Nulgath from /tercessuinotlim. Use the Reagent Library for details on how to get the following items:

DragonFire of Nulgath

Crimson Plate of Nulgath

Crimson Face Plate of Nulgath

Totem of Nulgath x3

Behemoth Blade of Light

Behemoth Blade of Shadow

Legion Fenrir Rune

In total, it's essentially 12 Totems of Nulgath and 1200 Combat Trophies.

After you get the DragonBlade of Nulgath, you can create the Legion DragonBlade of Nulgath, which is a stable version of the weapon but requires being a Legion member to obtain it.
