Requirements

Rank 10 Evil

Rank 7 Arcangrove

Unidentified 13
Required to accept each quest. Use the Reagent Library.

Step 1

Accept "Willpower Extraction" from Oblivion at /tercessuinotlim. If you haven't been here before, use the guide for it. You must complete this quest until you have 44 Unidentified 34s - it rewards 2, 4, 6, or 10 at an equal rate.

Use the Reagent Library for details on how to get the following items:

Shadow Lich

Unidentified 19

Necrot x5

Chaoroot x5

Doomatter x5

Mortality Cape of Revontheus

Essence of Nulgath x10

Facebreaker of Nulgath (Dagger)

Mystic Tribal Sword

ArchFiend's Favour x50

King Klunk's Crown

Totem of Nulgath

Step 2

Once you have 44 Uni 34s, you can begin "Nulgath Demands Work" from Oblivion. Complete it 4 times. The Unidentified 35 has a 30% chance to drop from the quest but if don't get it within 4 attempts, you'll need 10 more Unidentified 34s for every future attempt. Make sure to save 4 Uni 34s for the final quest. If you're very unlucky, you can merge 9 of the ArchFiend Essence Fragments to Swindle's Ripoff Emporium in /tercessuinotlim for the Uni 35.

Use the Reagent Library for details on how to get the following items:

Unidentified 34 x10

Dark Crystal Shard x30

Tainted Gem x15

Diamond of Nulgath x10

Blood Gem of the Archfiend x2

Since you use the Uni 13 in this quest, you'll need to farm a new one each time to accept the quest.

Step 3

Once you have a Uni 35, all 4 cosmetics from the previous quest, and a Nulgath's Approval (drops from /evilwarnul), you can begin "Enough DOOM for an ArchFiend" from Oblivion - make sure all the items are in your inventory so you can accept the quest.
