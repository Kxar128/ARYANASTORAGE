Introduction

This is the map that you must travel through to start many Nation quests and farms. It can't be directly travelled to using the /join command. Instead, you can get there via two ways:

Citadel
Join /citadel and enter the cave to the right. Take the following path: middle>right x3>enter portal.

Enchanted Nulgath Nation House
To get there even faster, use an ENNH. For example, enter /house ver0 into the chat box and walk upwards for the portal.

You will also need 50 Bone Dust, which is dropped from enemies at /battleunderb. Old guides will suggest obtaining other items, like Escherion's Chain, but this is not needed.
If you want to, you can make a private /tercessuinotlim by getting to the portal room of /citadel where the /join command is enabled.

All paths assume your position is the starting room of /tercessuinotlim.
