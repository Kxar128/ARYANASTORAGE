Tendurrr
Must own Oblivion Blade of Nulgath.

15% - "New Worlds, New Opportunities"
Nulgath's Birthday Gift

1% - "Nulgath (Larvae)"
Nulgath Larvae
Don't do this if you only want Totems of Nulgath as the drop rate is so low. This method is only mentioned if you plan on completing the quest anyway.

Choose Reward: "The Refreshing Deal"
Crag & Bamboozle
If you have spare Unidentified 10s and Blood Gems of the Archfiend, try completing this quest.
You need a Purified Claymore of Destiny to accept it, which is rewarded from Polish's "Purified Claymore" quest from /cragglerock. This quest requires Rank 8 Good and a Warrior Claymore Blade, which drops from Undead Berserkers at /marsh2.
After you have that, turn in the Uni 10s, Blood Gems, and farm Big Jack Sprat at /graveyard for the Undead Plague Spear.

Choose Reward: "Voucher Item: Totem of Nulgath" or "Totem of Nulgath"
Drudgen or Nulgath
For "Voucher Item: Totem of Nulgath", defeat Dark Makai at /tercessuinotlim or /nulgath for 60 Essence of Nulgath.
If you're doing Nulgath's quest, you only need 25 Essence of Nulgath but you also have to defeat Taro Manslayer (also at /tercessuinotlim) for his Taro's Manslayer weapon.
Either quest could be faster depending on what classes you have as you need a good soloing class to defeat Taro. You can also AFK at the Dark Makai's for passive kills/drops, just remember to attack at least once.
