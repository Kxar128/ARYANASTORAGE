Drops from the Shadow of Nulgath enemy at /tercessuinotlim. This enemy is off-screen but you can get to it by walking left>middle from the starting room. You'll know you're there because a Ninja Spy is in the same room. If you need to leave the room for any reason, take the top-left door and you should see Lae. To get back again, just walk through the top-left door and then up again.
