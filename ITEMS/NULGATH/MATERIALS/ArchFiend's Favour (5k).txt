Defeat enemies at /evilwarnul. Do this in is the first room with grass near the end of the map as it has 4 enemies. 

Alternatively, farm enemies at the start of the map while you complete one of Diligas' quests ("Crush the Weak" if member, "Only The Strong Survive Today" if not). This is slower but it will also reward Diamonds of Nulgath. You will need an Unidentified 13 to accept these quests and have completed Galanoth's quests at /lair including "Dragonslayer Reward".
