Swindle's quest is superior because it also rewards Receipts of Swindle, which can be used for other reagents in his shop. For both quests, defeat Box Guardians and Grizzlespit for Cubes (stacks to 500) at /boxes. Then, join /mountfrost to defeat Snow Golems in the 2nd room for Ice Cubes. Do this if you only want Tainted Gems as you will also get other reagents with the above methods. 

Alternative - Choose Reward - "The Poisonous Deal"
Crag & Bamboozle
Do this if you have spare Unidentified 10s and Blood Gems of the Archfiend.
