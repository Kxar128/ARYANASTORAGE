Follow one of these methods:

Purchase from Alina's Gebo Merge shop at /alchemyacademy. 

If you don't want to spend Gold, defeat Deathmoles and Crashrooms at /orecavern for Arashtite Ore and Dried Slime. Or, you can also use Chaoroot and Necrot if you already have them. I recommend having about 30 of each. Then, complete the Alchemy minigame at /alchemy - don't use Dragon Runestones for this. If you aren't experienced with Alchemy, see here - you will need to be Rank 8 Alchemy to do this. Additionally, merge any Soul Potions you get at Alina's shop at /alchemyacademy or save them for Hollowborn farms.
