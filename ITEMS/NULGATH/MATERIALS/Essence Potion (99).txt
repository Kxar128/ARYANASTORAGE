Obtain Necrot and either Chaoroot or Doomatter from Swindle's Ripoff Emporium at /tercessuinotlim or their respective drop-locations (see their sections throughout the page). After that, join /alchemy and select the Rune of Uruz, which unlocks at Rank 3 Alchemy. Don't use a Dragon Runestone for this.
