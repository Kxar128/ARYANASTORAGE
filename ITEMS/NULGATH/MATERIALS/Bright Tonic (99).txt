Either purchase this from Alina's Jera Merge shop at /alchemy academy or brew it with Arashtite Ore and Ice Vapour or Dragon Scales. I recommend about 20 or more of each. Choose your method:

Merge Gold Vouchers into Dragon Runestones in Alina's Get Dragon Runes shop at /alchemyacademy. Trade Dragon Runestones for the reagents in the Get Reagents shop.

Defeat Deathmoles at /orecavern and Water Draconians at /lair.

After that, join /alchemy and complete the Rune of Jera (the first one) or use Dragon Runestones. Use the Alchemy guide if you don't know how to do this.
