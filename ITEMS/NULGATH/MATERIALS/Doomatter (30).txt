Purchase a Receipt of Swindle from Swindle's Ripoff Emporium at /tercessuinotlim and trade it for 10 Doomatter.

 If you don't want to spend Gold, defeat Fear Feeder at the end of the map at /creepy. This requires membership.

If you're a non-member, join /vordredboss and click continue in the middle. As the cutscene is playing, you can't see it but you can actually still attack Vordred - just use a class that has powerful long-range abilities. This will skip a lot of the cutscene as you spam-click Next at the top-right. The final instance of the cutscene cannot be skipped by attacking.

If you don't want to spam that much, defeat Creature Creation at /maul.
