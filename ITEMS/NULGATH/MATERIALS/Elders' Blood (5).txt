You should complete "Experiment 107: Elders' Blood Potion" from Reens at /arcangrove as often as you can because it's a daily quest. If you don't know how to get to her, go up into the tower then walk into the blue portal at the bottom-right. To complete the quest, defeat Gorillaphants - this is best done at the bottom-right of the overall map as there are 2 on the same screen. You might also want to complete the other Potion quests from Reens as they require Gorillaphant and Seed Spitter drops - the below quest needs the Sparrow's Blood potion.

If you're a member who also owns Crag & Bamboozle, you could complete "Assisting Crag & Bamboozle" from Tendurrr the Assistant. This daily quest is useful for obtaining Void Highlord as it's normally gated by getting 1 Elders' Blood Potion each day. With this method you can get 2. Just remember to max-stack everything that you don't want to drop from this quest so that you can guarantee what you do want.
