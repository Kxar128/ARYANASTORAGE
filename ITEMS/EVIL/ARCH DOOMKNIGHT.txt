Storyline Completion

Quests

Go to the Ancient DoomKnight at /shadowvault and complete the following quests:

1. "Gathering Power"

Undead Energy x1800
Defeat enemies at /battleunderb.

Human Souls x500
Defeat Lightguard Paladins and Casters at /noxustower. There are two rooms near the end of the map that have 3 in them.

Dragon Energy x600
Defeat Draconians at /lair by exiting left from /underlair.



2. "Death's Door"

Death's Power & Souls of the Dead x400
Defeat Death at /shadowattack. He's located at the end of the map. If you've been to Death before by completing the quick storyline from /shadowrise > /shadowattack, you can click on the NPC's Battle Death Again button for a teleport.



3. "Chaotic Lords"

Chaotic Power x13
You'll earn these as you obtain the items below.

Escherion's Helm
Defeat Escherion at /escherion. 

Legendary Sword of Dragon Control
Defeat Vath at /stalagbite.

Hanzamune Dragon Koi Blade
Defeat Kitsune at /kitsune. He's invincible while in fox form.

Wolfwing Armour
Defeat Wolfwing at /wolfwing.

One Eyed Doll Breaker
Defeat Kimberly at /palooza.

Ledgermayne (Armour)
Defeat Ledgermayne at /ledgermayne.

Tibicenas (Armour)
Defeat Tibicenas at /djinn.

Soul of Chaos Armour
Defeat Khasaanda at /dreamnexus.

Chaos Lionfang Armour
Defeat Lionfang at /stormtemple.

Shorn Chaos King Crown
Defeat Alteon at either /swordhavenfalls or /ultraalteon. /ultraalteon has the benefit of also dropping Relics of Chaos. I suggest doing this with a group unless you have a very strong soloing class.

Xiang Chaos
Defeat Xiang at /mirrorportal. I suggest using Sentinel, Dragon of Time, or Healer for this fight as they all have abilities that deal damage based on your HP.

Drakath's Sword
Defeat Drakath at /ultradrakath.

Chaorrupted Hourglass
Defeat Iadoa at /timespace. I suggest getting a Dragonoid of Hours from Dragonoid at /mqlesson as it disables his Astral Shift ability - this doesn't need to be equipped to work, just in your inventory.



4. "A Means to an End"

Ultimate Darkness Gem x50
Join /shadowfallwar then walk up>right. Defeat the 2 Ghouls and 2 Undead War Mages.

Undead Energy x2000
Defeat enemies at /battleunderb.

(Necro) Scroll of Dark Arts x2
Defeat Ultra Vordred at /epicvordred (~1% drop rate).

Doom Heart
Defeat Ultra Sepulchure at /sepulchurebattle (~0.5% drop rate).

Dread Knight Cleaver
Defeat Dark Sepulchure at /sepulchure.

Reaper's Soul
Defeat Reaper at /thevoid. You can access them quickly by selecting Fight Me! from the NPC version of The Reaper at the beginning of the map.

Desolich's Undead Eye x2
Defeat Desolich at /desolich. Group up for this as even with a strong soloing class, it'd take a very long time to take it down.
