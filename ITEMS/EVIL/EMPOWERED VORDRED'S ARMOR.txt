Quests

Complete the following quests from Vordred at /stonewood:

1. "SKULLS"

Defeat enemies at /warundead.



2. "MORE SKULLS"

Bone Axe
Defeat Big Jack Sprat at /graveyard.

Spine Gripper
Defeat Angry Undead Giant at /battleundera (walk left then up) - 1% drop rate.

Dread Staff
If you're a member, defeat Abaddon and Dreadspider at /twilight (walk right). Otherwise, defeat Dreadspider at /marsh.

O-dokuro Blade
Defeat O-dokuro at /odokuro.

Ancient Skull Blade
Purchase from Rayst's shop at /arcangrove.

Dracolich Destroyer Scythe
Defeat Avatar of Desolich at /dragonheart. It can be found by walking to the very left of the map then walking up and continuing right.

Screaming Might
Merge 10 Dark Palace Tokens at Aeneas' shop at /dagefortress. Just defeat enemies at the starting screen for them.

Boneblade of Gorgorath
Defeat Gorgorath at /wrath or /dragonbone (located at end of map). If you haven't done any of the Seven Deadly Dragons story, complete the quests at /dragonbone to access Gorgorath.



3. "MORE SKULLS ON THE SKULLS"

Shadow Lich
Purchase from Gravelyn at /shadowfall in the Evil Reputation shop (quickly access by exiting left from /shadowvoid).

Escherion's Robe
Defeat Escherion at /escherion. You can either /goto someone who's there or complete Escherion's 13LoC saga from the Map > Story.

Undead Terror Armour
Defeat Bone Terror at /battleundera by exiting right from /battleunderb.

Skulls of the Necromancer
Defeat Shadow Dragon at /necrocavern (get there quickly by selecting Necrocavern from Braeus' fast travel at /shadowfall then walk down).

Undead Warrior Executioner
Obtain the Undead Warrior Bruiser armour by defeating Revontheus at /underworld (located near end of map). Then, obtain 100 Dage's Approvals and 75 Dage's Favours from enemies in the same map - either do this in the room after the orange sphere portal or 3 rooms left of Revontheus. Then, merge all the items in Rogath's Favour shop at the start of the map (it's faster to rejoin /underworld than walk back).



4. "MORE SKULLS ON THOSE SKULLS"

Desolich's Skull x5
Defeat Desolich at /desolich - it has over 8m HP. I highly recommend grouping up for this and the other bosses in this quest.

Undead Raxgore's Skull x10
Defeat Raxgore at /doomvaultb. You'll need to complete the quests from /doomvault > /doomvaultb to access him as /goto doesn't not work. If you've done this already, you can get to Raxgore faster by talking to Valencia at /museum and selecting Artifact Quests > Armour of Awe > To the Crossroads. Then talk to Valencia again and select Armour of Awe > AQW Legend/Hero > More Details > Helm Boss.
While fighting him, be careful as he can lock your abilities and has an ability called Counter Attack - you'll need to target off by clicking the X to the top-right of their portrait or pressing ESC. Use the chance to get the Helm of Awe if you haven't already.

Legion Lich Lord's Skull x15
Defeat Legion Lich Lord at /frozenlair. I highly suggest doing this in a group but if you're doing this alone, you will need a dodge class like Yami no Ronin, Chrono Assassin, Horc Evader, etc. 

Reaper's Skull x20
Defeat Reaper at /thevoid. You can access them quickly by selecting Fight Me! from the NPC version of The Reaper at the beginning of the map.



5. "VOIDUMINANCE"

(Necro) Scroll of Dark Arts
Defeat Ultra Vordred at /epicvordred (~1% drop rate). You might want to group up for this.

Noxus Runes
Defeat Extreme Noxus at /lightguardwar. You either need to /goto someone or complete the quests from /noxustower > /lightguardwar to access him. Then, select Challenge > To Battle from Noxus to access him.

Sally's Necronomicon
Purchase from Sally at /necrotower for 20m Gold.

Ancient Evil of the Necropolis
Defeat 5 Headed Dracolich at /necrodungeon. If there is no one at the boss to /goto, the directions are: get to the elevator > walk right to next elevator > enter the right door > walk right to next elevator > at the doom crawler, walk up into train > walk right to next elevator > enter right door and continue right.



6. "Empower Vordred's Armour"

Have SDKA in your inventory and purchase Vordred's Armour from /stonewood to accept the quest then defeat Ultra Vordred at /epicvordred.
