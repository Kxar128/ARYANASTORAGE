Quest

Barnaby's "Sailor of the Celestial Skies" quest from /pirates is only available during September. Many of the enemies you need to defeat are very hard, so I highly suggest doing it in a group. Defeat the following enemies for each item:

Sapphire Orb x5
Legion Lich Lord at /frozenlair.

Rumours of the Celestial Commander x5
Diabolical Warlord at /lostruinswar (located at end of map).

Page 1 Scraps x10
Animuses of Ice at /iceplane (requires completing map's quests or /goto).

Page 2 Scraps x10
Ivoliss at /ivoliss (located at end of map).

Page 3 Scraps x10
Nightbane at /thevoid (keep walking right and back to get the correct spawn).

Page 4 Scraps x10
Ultra SN.O.W. at /extinction (requires completing map's quests or /goto).

Map of the Celestial Seas
Empowered Prime at /starsinc (requires completing map's quests to get the Guard's Key or /goto).

Coffer of the Stars
ArchFiend Dragonlord at /underlair (located at end of map).

Other pieces from this quest have the same boosts but having them in a pet is more convenient.
