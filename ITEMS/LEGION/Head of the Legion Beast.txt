Penance x60
Merge these at /sevencircleswar. Access the shop by clicking on Virgil at the top-right. In total, you need:

Essence of Wrath x60 - stacks to 300
Accept "Guards of Wrath" from Virgil then defeat Wrath Guards.
If you have a strong soloing class or you're in a group, defeat the Wrath boss with the "Wrath Against the Machine" quest accepted, which will be faster.

Essence of Violence x60 - stacks to 300
Accept "Meaningless Violence" then defeat Violence Guards.
If you have a strong soloing class or you're in a group, defeat the Violence boss with the "Violence" quest accepted.

With a strong soloing class or group, defeat the Treachery boss with the "Hanged for Treason" quest accepted.

Souls of Heresy x900 - stacks to 300
Defeat Wrath Guards and turn in War and Mega War Medals at the top-right. This is also one of the best methods in the game for farming Gold.

Beast Soul x15
Obtain these from The Beast at /sevencircleswar - you'll need a group to do this efficiently.

After you have all the above reagents, purchase the 3 Helms that cost Indulgence from the /sevencircles merge. Then, buy the 3 Helms that cost Penance from /sevencircleswar and merge them for the Helms of the Seven Circles misc item in the same shop. Now you can merge the Head of the Legion Beast.
